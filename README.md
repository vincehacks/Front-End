### PRINCIPLES

#### B.E.M

- B.E.M stands for Block Element Modifier
- Standard naming convention for CSS class names
- **Block**: The outermost parent element of the component is defined as a block
- **Element**: Inside of the component may be one or more children called
  elements
- **Modifier**: Either a block or element may have a variation signified by a
  modifier
- Ex. [block]\_\_[element]--[Modifier]

#### S.O.L.I.D PRINCIPLES OF OOP

- Acronym for 5 design principles to make software more understandable, flexible
  & maintainable

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**
   - A class should have only one single responsibility
2. **Open/Closed Principle**
   - Software Entities should be open for extension, but closed for
     modification
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle**
   - Objects in a program should be replaceable w/ instances of their subtypes
     without altering correctness of that program
4. **Interface Segregation Principle**
   - Many client specific interfaces are better than on general purpose
     interface
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle**
   - One should depend upon abstractions, not concretions

#### CLIENTS & SERVERS

- **Clients**: Web users internet connected devices
- Ex. Computer is connected to WiFi or phone is connected to network
- **Servers**: Computers that store webpages, sites, apps
- When a client device wants to connect to a webpage, a copy of the webpage is
  downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the
  user's web browser

#### EXTRA
