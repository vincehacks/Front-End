Here is where I post useful information on HTML

#### HOW TO OPTIMIZE HTML

- [Compressing JPEG](https://compressjpeg.com/)
- [Website Optimization](http://www.websiteoptimization.com/)
- [Performance Rules](http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html)
- [Page Speed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/)
- [Paint Flashing Tool](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Paint_Flashing_Tool)

#### NOTES

- Img tags can be used both in html and css if it is in css then is just for
  decoration. Like the background img. If it’s actual pictures of things then
  use img. You can’t do alt in css only img
- Window is the global context
