web content

#### ANALYZING HTML

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

- Cared about this in the past
- Use to be used for setting the rules
- Used for parsing and let's the web know what version is being used

```HTML
<html></html>
```

- A.K.A the root element
- All HTML is wrapped inside

```HTML
<head></head>
```

- Everything you want to include that is not going to be seen, meta information
- Ex. keywords/page descriptpon for searching and SEO

```HTML
<meta charset="utf-8">
```

- Character set uses **utf-8** which has most characters in many languages

```HTML
<title></title>
```

- Appears in the browser page tab

```HTML
<body></body>
```

- All content page viewers will see

```HTML
<img src="image.jpg" alt="placeholder for image"></title>>
```

- `alt="test"` will show the text, this will be used if the image can't be
  displayed or a screen reader will read what is on the screen for people with
  disabilities
