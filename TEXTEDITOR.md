#### My Installed Packages for Atom

- Monokai UI Theme: - Sublime's UI theme color uses this one
- Emmet Auto Complete HTML: - Emmet is the number one code snippet tool used by
  front end developers.
  Emmet helps to create HTML and CSS faster with the use of snippets. It uses
  abbreviations that expand to valid HTML tags.
- File icons: - The File Icons package displays specific and meaningful icons
  next to
  files in your file-tree, fuzzy-finder, and tabs. They help to visually
  parse file types with little effort. You can choose between colored or
  monochrome icons.
- Minimap: - The Minimap package displays a Minimap preview of your file on the
  right
  hand side of your editor. You can turn code highlights on and off, as well
  as change the preview to be on the left-hand side if you wish. It also has
  a ton of other customizations if you want to dig deeper.
- Highlight-selected: - The Highlight Selected package is super simple, it
  highlights the current
  word selected on double click. Especially useful if you’re looking for a
  particular method name or function within a file without having to open the
  find panel.
- Autocomplete-modules
- Pigments: - The Pigments package displays colors in project files, wherever it
  parses a color to be. It’s super helpful to easily determine what a specific
  hex code might be, especially if the color isn’t labelled by a variable.
